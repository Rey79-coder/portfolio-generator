DEVELOPER NOTES:

The app.js file contains two similar functions.
One is to create/modify index from root directory.
Second is to create a copy inside of src/dist.


page-template.js file contains most of the inserted HTML used for every deployment.

generate-site.js file contains promises and those will be create/modify/deployed from utils dir.
